     <p><b>As I read the spec these things you are talking about are Element Refinements (like created, modified, etc. for date).
        Element Refinement: These qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. A client that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. The definitions of element refinement terms for qualifiers must be publicly available.</b></p>
