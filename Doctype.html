      <p><i><b>Basically, the <u>DOCTYPE</u> describes the <u>HTML</u> that will be used in your page.
        Browsers also use the DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Not including a DOCTYPE or including an incorrect one can trigger quirks mode.
        The kicker here is, that quirks mode in Internet Explorer is quite different from quirks mode in Firefox (and other browsers); meaning that you'll have a much harder job, trying to ensure your page renders consistently with all browsers if the quirks mode is triggered, than you will if it is rendered in standards mode.</b></i></p>
